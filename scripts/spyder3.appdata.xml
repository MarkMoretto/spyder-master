    <p>
      Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts.
      It features a unique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging and profiling functionality of a comprehensive development tool
      with the data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection and beautiful visualization capabilities of an analysis package.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, Spyder offers built-in integration with many popular scientific libraries,
      including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, IPython, QtConsole, Matplotlib, SymPy, and more, and can be extended further with full plugin support.
      Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5 extension library, allowing you to build upon its functionality and embed its components,
      such as the interactive console, in your own software.
